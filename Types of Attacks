Phishing: Spam emails to get sensitive information by clone sites from victim

Pharming: DNS poisioning by redirecting from right webpages to scam, fraud and attacker webpages

Smishing: SMS phishing with enclosed scam, fraud links

Impersonation: Where attacker try to pretend like who is he not actually like from Bank, Government org, Microsoft

Reconnaissance: Information gathering of victim from public sources like Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin etc

Eliciting Information: Human Hacking by calling, voice messaging, emailing etc to get sensitive information

Credential Harvesting: (Marco downloads the credential harvesting malware) Attker can send a malware in form of docs file or other format

Tailgating: Is getting access of victim machine

Social Engineering: The technicques and tactics uses to manupilate people for information gathering over call, messages, email etc.

Malware: Is a malicious program or software can be used, which is use to gain unauthorize access of any machine

Types of Malware:
  Viruses: it doesn't replicate it self until user launch or install it by theirself into the machine.
  Crypto-malware:
  Ransomware: Is a kind of program uses to Locked/hack system of whale companies and ask them for money to give them the access back of their data.
  Worms: Replicate/ travel very quick/fast itself computer to computer without human interaction and by taking the advantage of system vulnerabilities. it is also uses to open backdoor and by using Doublepulsar
  Torjan horse: create backdoors to get into a system, to remote access torjon (RATs), Key logging, screenrecording, screenshots, performaing adminstaration task, can configure registry, change functions, Run scripts
  Rootkit: software runs in kernel invisibally, difficult to find and remove (casue it integrates itself with system files which cannot be delete in the runing OS)
  Keylogger: 
  Adware/Spyware: Adware (Shows Advertisement pop-ups, Performance Issues, Install accidentally, attacker makes money by displaying ads), Monitor Browsing activities to know waht we are doing, and keystrokes to our usernames and passwords. 
  Botnet: use to DOS and DDOS
  Logic Bombs: Get into secretly and wait for the right time to attack, and after that it distroy and clean itself, by Master boot, record deleting, system reboots, difffcult to find by scanners

After 2019 the term came out hash, which basically purpose was to encrypt passwords more by hashing like assigning orignal password 
char with large lenght of numbers, alphabets, special characters like (39b03f15d6f58cd51dv5vdv45vd44dv54dv545:::).

Spring Attack: attackting with the specific and most common list of passwords

Brute Force: passowrd cracking attacking by password lists (very time consuming)

Dictionary attack: Brute force Attack by using very specific list of passwords

Physical Attacks: Through USB cabels, USB, and ATM machines

Cryptographic Attack: MIT men in the middle attack

Privilege Escalation: Gain Higher Level access of a system by Exploiting Vulnerabilities

Cross-site Scripting XSS: where attacker insert a link/malicious code of malware in the insert box of webpage such as shopping carts, 
                          so that when receiver will click the link and attacker will get the access of victim machine. In other case
                          attacker can also integrate his malicious program by link the webpage server, and then every visitor of that
                          webpage will become victim and will compromise their systems.
Injection Attacks: Injecting piece of code to exploit the vulnerability of application/software.
                   Languages can be used to prepare injection:
                    SQL (Structured Query Language): Use to get information for DB by injecting SQL code
                    XML (Extensible Markup Language): Aset of rule of transfer data and storage
                    LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Modify LDAp requests to manipulate application results 
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): 
                    DLL (Dynamic Link Library): way to inject some code to execute the application code for us. 

Buffer overflows: This appears due to the Lack of web/app developer, it's hard to find, mostly can be attack by DOS and DDOS

Replay Attack: Is use to steal credentials and session IDs by sniffing a network and ARP poisoning (WIFI Hacking, MIT Attack)

Request Forgeries: where attacker can use victim system by pretending like victim to target/access the sensitive information 
                   about victim such as credentials, social media accounts, bank acount details, browsing activities from the
                   most securist servers such as facebook, instagram, youtube, chrome, bank website etc.
                   (Don't save passwords in browser directories)

Driver Manipulation: Is use to driver alteration to take advantage from the victim system

SSL Striping: where sit in the middle of victim and server to sniff the network to get information, 
              we can also call this MITM attack (men in the middle), resources can be use proxy server, ARP Spoofing, Rogue WIFI hotspot, etc
                                                     
                                                    HOW IT WORKS:
              [Victim] -> http:\\example.com ->  [Attacker] ->http:\\example.com             -> [Server]
              [Victim] ->                    ->  [Attacker] <- 301 moved (req to move https) <- [Server]
              [Victim] ->                    ->  [Attacker] -> https:\\example.com           -> [Server]
              [Victim] ->                    ->  [Attacker] <- response 200 OK               <- [Server]
              (HERE ATTACKER WILL DECRYPT THE RESPONSE AND CONVERT TO HTTP THEN SEND IT TO THE VICTIM)
              [Victim] <- http:\\example.com <-  [Attacker]                                     [Server]
                                                                                    

Other Application Attack: this is a type of attack where attacker install an application in the phone of victim and get complete access.

Rougue access points and evil twins: this is a way where attacker can get access of internet device using an wireless access point and then he can monitor all the traffic over internet by assigning himself as a router or MIA

Bluejacking and Bluesnarffing: it the proccess where an attacker can connect with your device and via bluetooth and can steal your data or also can perform MIA.

Wireless disassociation attack (required WAP or WIFI Adaptor): This attack can be perform to disconnect a device from internet by sending deauth packets or to steal handshake file.

RFID (Radio frequency indentification) attack spy uses: this is a radio frequency chp in the size of rice grain which transmit data from one point to another point.

NFC (Near field communication) attack : this is look like a chip with pattern and work with radar frequecy radiations, mostly use in atm, id cards or in phones.so be carefuk before pinch the chip cause an attacker can also steal data with this.
